      As interesting as cuteness research is, science has its limits. After all,
      how can you study the softness of your cat’s ears? Or the rumble of their
      purrs against your chest? Or the sparkle in their eyes when you walk in
      the door? And while we’re on it, why are cats’ paws so cute?! According to
      our own research, here are 10 other reasons cats are so cute.
    </p>

    <h3>1. They knead the sweetest biscuits.</h3>

    <p>
      Another reason we love kitty paws? Biscuits! Many cats “knead” soft
      surfaces, a nursing behavior left over from kittenhood. When a cat “makes
      biscuits” on their human, it’s thought to be a sign of affection.
    </p>

    <h3>2. They have the softest, silliest bellies.</h3>
    <p>
      Even trim cats have soft, cozy bellies thanks to the primordial pouch, a
      paunchy bit of skin, fat, and fur that runs the length of the abdomen.
      There are a number of theories as to why the pouch exists, but we know
      this for sure: it’s very cute.
    </p>

    <h3>3. They take napping to the (adorable) extreme.</h3>
    <p>
      When it comes to naps, cats are ninja masters. Whether you’ve ever
      discovered your feline friend sleeping upside down in a box on top of the
      refrigerator or snuggled up on your head, you understand how cute (and
      confusing) it can be.
    </p>

    <h3>4. Their tails have minds of their own.</h3>

    <p>
      Whether curling, flicking, or swishing, cat tails are fluffy little
      beacons of cuteness. But it’s not just for show – cats communicate quite a
      bit through their tail language, so it’s important to pay attention!
    </p>

    <h3>5. They’re not shy about wanting pets.</h3>
    <p>
      Cats have a reputation for playing it cool. But when they really want to
      be pet, they’re shameless – and we’re here for it. Whether forcefully
      shoving their heads into your hands or rubbing against your leg, cats are
      the cutest
    </p>
    cuddle thieves.

    <h3>6. They have the sweetest meows.</h3>
    <p>
      Do you ever feel like your cute cat uses a special language, just for you?
      It’s not that far-fetched. While kittens meow to communicate with their
      mothers, adult cats only meow to communicate their needs to humans,
      preferring vocalizations such as yowls, trills, and growls when “talking”
      to each other. It’s almost as if they consider us mama cats – and that,
      friends, is Peak Cute.
    </p>

    <h3>7. They bring us “gifts.”</h3>
    <p>
      Not everyone considers headless mice “gifts.” But to cats, an offering of
      disembodied prey is likely a sign of affection. Aww!
    </p>

    <h3>8. They know when we’re sad.</h3>
    <p>
      Plenty of studies have shown that cats recognize and respond to human
      emotions. But if a cat has ever curled up in your lap after a long,
      disappointing day, you know our feline friends have a sixth sense that
      science can’t fully explain.
